# 1. Introduction
Thank you for downloading **TutorAid**! TutorAid is a desktop app **for private tutors to track their students' contacts**.

The main features of TutorAid include:
1. Storing contacts of students and their parents
2. Storing and managing lesson details
3. Tracking students' progress
4. Tracking students' payment status

With TutorAid, you have a one-stop solution for keeping track of your students' contacts and staying up-to-date on their progress. TutorAid is optimised for use via a **Command Line Interface** (CLI) while retaining the benefits of a visually-appealing Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TutorAid can help you to manage your tutoring tasks more efficiently than traditional GUI apps.

We hope that TutorAid will be helpful in adding more organisation to your tutoring career. To get TutorAid up and running, check out the [Quick Start](#3-quick-start) section.<hr>

# 2. About
This section contains information and terms that may help you to understand the user guide.

## 2.1 User Guide formatting

Formats discussed in this section may be used in relevant areas of this user guide.

**Tips**

Tips are helpful suggestions that may improve your experience using TutorAid.

> :bulb: This is helpful.

**Warnings**

Warnings can inform you of things that should be followed carefully to prevent unwanted behaviour.

> :exclamation: **This is important!**

**Commands**

Commands in these highlighted boxes are typically used to show what you should enter into TutorAid.

`command`<hr>

## 2.2 TutorAid visual components
This section details the various components in TutorAid and how they will be referred to throughout the guide.
![Labelled Ui](images/labelled-ui.jpg)

#### Menu Bar
This is an area where some features can be found. As TutorAid primarily interacts with you through the command box, this area is infrequently used.

#### Command Box
The Command Box is a field in which you can type instructions (commands) to TutorAid. Text in this user guide that is `highlighted` should typically be copied into the command box exactly (including spaces). After you have typed a command into this box, you can press ENTER :leftwards_arrow_with_hook: on your keyboard to tell TutorAid to execute your command.

If your command is of the wrong [format](#23-command-format), TutorAid will try to show you the correct format using the Console if it is able to guess what command you had intended to provide.

#### Console
The Console is used by TutorAid to communicate with you. Whenever a command is carried out, TutorAid will let you know whether the operation was successful. It may also provide you with details about the changes made during the operation.

#### Student Panel
The Student Panel is where your students are listed. There are two modes for this panel: **Full** and **Minimal**. Full view means that all details about each student is listed, whereas Minimal view allows you to see only their name and their index number. These modes can be set via [the list command](#listing-all-students--list). In the labelled screenshot, the Student Panel is in Minimal view.

> :bulb: The **index number** is important for many commands in TutorAid.

#### Lesson Panel
The Lesson Panel is where your lessons are listed. Just like the Student Panel, there are the **Full** and **Minimal** modes which determine how much information is displayed. In the labelled screenshot, the Lesson Panel is in Full view.

> :bulb: The **index number** of a lesson is important too, and is used in commands just like the index number for students.

#### Status Bar
The status bar shows the path where you can find the save file for TutorAid.<hr>

## 2.3 Command Format
Commands are text that you can enter into the Command Box to tell TutorAid to perform an operation. Some commands have many components, each of which serve different purposes. The following diagram depicts the components of a command.

![](images/command-syntax.png)

#### Command Word
The command word is how you can tell TutorAid what kind of operation you want to do. These command words are listed [here](#6-command-summary). All commands must contain a command word.

In the example above, `edit` tells TutorAid to perform an *edit* operation.

#### Flag
The flag is used to differentiate between variants of the same operation. For example, the `edit` command word can be used to edit the details of a student or a lesson. To differentiate between these usages, you should pass a flag to TutorAid - `edit -s` to edit a student, or `edit -l` to edit a lesson.

In the example above, `-s` tells TutorAid to perform the edit operation on *students*.

#### Index Number
Some commands perform operations on a specific student or lesson. You should give TutorAid an index number to specify a student or a lesson. The index number can be found by looking at the respective panels - the [Student Panel](#student-panel) or the [Lesson Panel](#lesson-panel).

In the example above, `3` tells TutorAid to perform the edit operation on the *third student*.

#### Parameter
A parameter contains the *specifics* of the command to be executed. There can be **multiple** parameters for a single command, depending on the type of command that you wish to perform. Arguments are prefixed with a few characters followed by a slash (`sn/` and `sp/` for this example). These prefixes help TutorAid to differentiate parameters.

> :bulb: `sn/` is the prefix for Student Name and `sp/` is the prefix for Student Phone.

In the example above, `sn/Matthew Judge` tells TutorAid that the third student should be edited *by changing their name to Matthew Judge*. Similarly, `sp/91263740` tells TutorAid that the third student should be edited *by changing their student mobile number to the specified number*.

### 2.3.1 Command Syntax in this Guide
In this guide, the syntax / format of a command is shown like this:

`edit -s INDEX_NUMBER [sn/STUDENT_NAME] [sp/STUDENT_PHONE] [pn/PARENT_NAME] [pp/PARENT_PHONE]`
`add -sl s/STUDENT_INDEX... n/LESSON_INDEX...`

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user and can contain spaces.
* Items in square brackets are optional.
* Parameters can be in any order.
* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but if you specify it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.
* `...` signals that multiple parameters of this type can be accepted(separated by a space), but there must be at least one parameter present.
  e.g. if the format of a command has `s/STUDENT_INDEX...` then both `s/1 2 3` and `s/1` are acceptable inputs, but not `s/ `.
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters will be ignored.
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
