# 1. Introduction

Thank you for downloading **TutorAid**! TutorAid is a desktop app **for private tutors to keep track of the details of 
their students and lessons**.

Some main ways in which TutorAid can help you with your tutoring responsibilities include:
1. Storing of your students' and their parents' contacts
2. Storing and managing of your lesson details
3. Tracking of your students' progress

TutorAid is a unique app that is optimised for use via a **Command Line Interface** (CLI) while retaining the benefits 
of a visually-appealing Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TutorAid can help you to manage your 
tutoring tasks more efficiently than traditional GUI apps!

We hope that TutorAid will be helpful in adding more organisation to your tutoring career. 

Just downloaded TutorAid? Check out the [Quick Start](#3-quick-start) section to see how you can get the app up and 
running!

> :bulb: This is helpful.

**Warnings**

Warnings can inform you of things that should be followed carefully to prevent unwanted behaviour.

> :exclamation: **This is important!**

**Commands**

Commands in these highlighted boxes are typically used to show what you should enter into TutorAid.

`command`

***

## 2.2 TutorAid visual components

This section details the various components in TutorAid and how they will be referred to throughout the guide.
![Labelled Ui](images/labelled-ui.jpg)

#### Menu Bar
{:.no_toc}
This is an area where some features can be found. As TutorAid primarily interacts with you through the command box, this area is infrequently used.

#### Command Box
{:.no_toc}
The Command Box is a field in which you can type instructions (commands) to TutorAid. Text in this user guide that is `highlighted` should typically be copied into the command box exactly (including spaces). After you have typed a command into this box, you can press ENTER :leftwards_arrow_with_hook: on your keyboard to tell TutorAid to execute your command.

If your command is of the wrong [format](#23-command-format), TutorAid will try to show you the correct format in the Console if it is able to infer what command you had intended to provide.

#### Console
{:.no_toc}
The Console is used by TutorAid to communicate with you. Whenever a command is carried out, TutorAid will let you know whether the operation was successful. It may also provide you with details about the changes made during the operation.

#### Student Panel
{:.no_toc}
The Student Panel is where your students are listed. There are two modes for this panel: **Full** and **Minimal**. Full view means that all details about each student is listed, whereas Minimal view allows you to see only their name and their index number. These modes can be set via [the list command](#listing-all-students-and-lessons-list). In the labelled screenshot, the Student Panel is in Minimal view.

> :bulb: The **index number** is important for many commands in TutorAid.

#### Lesson Panel
{:.no_toc}
The Lesson Panel is where your lessons are listed. Just like the Student Panel, there are the **Full** and **Minimal** modes which determine how much information is displayed. In the labelled screenshot, the Lesson Panel is in Full view.

> :bulb: The **index number** of a lesson is important too, and is used in commands just like the index number for students.

#### Status Bar
{:.no_toc}
The status bar shows the path where you can find the save file for TutorAid.

***

## 2.3 Command Format

Commands are text that you can enter into the Command Box to tell TutorAid to perform an operation. Some commands have many components, each of which serve different purposes. The following diagram depicts the components of a command:

![](images/command-syntax.png)

#### Command Word
{:.no_toc}
The command word is how you can tell TutorAid what kind of operation you want to do. These command words are listed [here](#8-command-summary). All commands must contain a command word.

In the example above, `edit` tells TutorAid to perform an *edit* operation.

#### Flag
{:.no_toc}
The flag is used to differentiate between variants of the same operation. For example, the `edit` command word can be used to edit the details of a student or a lesson. To differentiate between these usages, you should pass a flag to TutorAid - `edit -s` to edit a student, or `edit -l` to edit a lesson.

In the example above, the flag `-s` tells TutorAid to perform the edit operation on *students*.

#### Index Number
{:.no_toc}
Some commands perform operations on a specific student or lesson. You should give TutorAid an index number to specify a student or a lesson. The index number can be found by looking at the respective panels - the [Student Panel](#student-panel) or the [Lesson Panel](#lesson-panel).

In the example above, `3` tells TutorAid to perform the edit operation on the *third student* in the Student Panel.

#### Parameter
{:.no_toc}
A parameter contains the *specifics* of the command to be executed. There can be **multiple** parameters for a single command, depending on the type of command that you wish to perform. Arguments are prefixed with a few characters followed by a slash (`sn/` and `sp/` for this example). These prefixes help TutorAid to differentiate parameters.

> :bulb: `sn/` is the prefix for Student Name and `sp/` is the prefix for Student Phone.

In the example above, `sn/Matthew Judge` tells TutorAid that the third student should be edited *by updating their name to Matthew Judge*. Similarly, `sp/91263740` tells TutorAid that the third student should be edited *by updating their student mobile number to the specified number*.

### 2.3.1 Command Syntax in this Guide
In this guide, the syntax / format of a command is shown like this:

`edit -s INDEX_NUMBER [sn/STUDENT_NAME] [sp/STUDENT_PHONE] [pn/PARENT_NAME] [pp/PARENT_PHONE]`
`add -sl s/STUDENT_INDEX... n/LESSON_INDEX...`

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters that are to be supplied by you. They can contain spaces.
* Items in square brackets are optional.
* Parameters can be in any order.
* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, and you specify it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.
* `...` signals that multiple parameters of this type can be accepted(separated by a space), but there must be at least one parameter present.
  e.g. if the format of a command has `s/STUDENT_INDEX...` then both `s/1 2 3` and `s/1` are acceptable inputs, but not `s/ `.
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters will be ignored.
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

***

# 3. Quick Start

1. Ensure that you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `tutoraid.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-3/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your TutorAid.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. An application window similar to the one below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br><br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)
   
5. If this is your first time using TutorAid, we highly encourage you to check out our [Beginner's Tutorial](#4-beginners-tutorial) so that you can practise using some of the commands and familiarise yourself with the app!

6. After completing the tutorial, refer to the [Features](#8-command-summary) below to see all the commands available in TutorAid.

***

# 4. Beginner's tutorial

Welcome to TutorAid's beginner's tutorial! Here, you will learn how you can use some of our commands to manage the details of your students and lessons on a day-to-day basis.

If this is your first time launching TutorAid, you will be able to see that some sample data has been provided to you. For this tutorial, let's assume that you tutor the student(s) 
shown in the Student Panel and that you offer the lesson(s) shown in the Lesson Panel. 

### Step 1: Adding a student
{:.no_toc}
First, imagine a new student, John Yeo, has just approached you for your tutoring services, and you wish to record down his students details in TutorAid so that you can keep track of his details and refer to them when needed. Furthermore, John Yeo has also given you the following details:
* John's phone number: 98765432
* John's parent's name: Mary Yeo
* John's parent's phone number: 81234567

You can then easily add his data to TutorAid by following the steps below:
1. Key in `add -s sn/John Yeo sp/98765432 pn/Mary Yeo pp/81234567` into the command box. 
> :bulb: If John did not provide you with his phone number, parent's name and parent's phone number, you can still add his student details to TutorAid by keying in `add -s sn/John Yeo` into the command box, since those are optional details for you to include in the command.
2. Upon pressing enter, all specified details belonging to John Yeo will be added and stored in TutorAid.

Now, the Student Panel will be updated accordingly with John's details. If you do not see John's details on your screen, you can either scroll down the Student Panel to find his details, or enter the command `find -s John Yeo` to display only his details in the Student Panel.

### Step 2: Adding a lesson
{:.no_toc}
Now that you've added your first student (and perhaps a few others too), let's add some Lessons to TutorAid. In this tutorial, we will be adding a lesson named History 1 into TutorAid by performing the steps below:

1. Type `add -l n/History 1` into the command box and press enter.

    ![](images/tutorialAddLesson1.png)

2. Observe how History 1 appears in the Lesson Panel.
3. We've added the lesson successfully, but we can continue by adding more details, such as its timing (10AM - 11AM on Mondays), price ($125.90) and capacity (10). Assuming that History 1 is the only lesson in your Lesson Panel, type the command `edit -l 1 t/10AM - 11AM on Mondays c/10`. Press Enter on your keyboard.
4. Observe how the capacity and timing now show what you have requested.
> :bulb: If you know what details you wish to add from the beginning, you can type `add -l n/History 1 c/10 t/10 AM - 11AM on Mondays p/125.90` to enter these details in a single command.
5. That's it, you've added your first lesson. If you need more information, you can check out the detailed documentation of the [add lesson](#adding-a-lesson-add--l) and [edit lesson](#editing-a-lesson-edit--l) commands.

### Step 4: Adding a progress note for a student
{:.no_toc}
Now, imagine you have ended your 'Maths 1' lesson. You realised that one of your students, Alex Yeoh, seems to struggle with the topic 'Vectors', and you wish to take 
note of it so that you can provide him extra practice. To do so, you can easily add a progress note for Alex on TutorAid by following the steps below: 
1. Key in `find -s Alex Yeoh` into the command box. This would result in only Alex's details being displayed in the student panel.
2. Key in `add -p 1 Weak in Vectors and requires extra practice` into the command box. Alex's details will then be updated to display the progress note you just added. 

Alternatively, you can also do this:
1. Key in `list` in the command box to see list of all your students in the student panel.
2. Locate `Alex Yeoh` in the student panel and take note of his index. In this case, it would be `1`.
3. Key in `add -p 1 Weak in Vectors and requires extra practice` into the command box. Alex's details will then be updated to display the progress note you just added.

Now, the next time you open TutorAid, you will be able to see Alex's progress note at a glance! 

You will be able to add up to **10** such progress notes for each student. When you attempt to add an 11th note, your very first note will be automatically deleted, and your new note will be added in.

> :bulb: We support up to just 10 notes to ensure that the progress notes for each student are easy to view and manage.

### Step 5: Deleting a student
{:.no_toc}
Lastly, imagine one of your students `Roy Balakrishnan` has graduated from secondary school and no longer requires your tutoring services. You wish to remove his student details
since he is no longer your student. To do so, you can easily delete his data from TutorAid by following the steps below:
1. Type `list` in the command box to see the list of all your students in the Student Panel.
2. Locate `Roy Balakrishnan` in the Student Panel and take note of his index. In this case, it would be `6`.
3. Type `del -s 6` into the command box. Upon pressing enter, all details belonging to `Roy Balakrishnan` will be removed.

Now, the Student and Lesson Panels will be updated accordingly without any data of `Roy Balakrishnan`.

### End
{:.no_toc}
Congratulations on successfully completing TutorAid's beginner's tutorial :tada: 
But why quit now? Since you have completed the tutorial, you can go ahead and key in `clear` in the command box to remove all the sample data and to add in some of your own students and lessons. 
You can also experiment with some of the other TutorAid commands that are listed below in [Features](#5-features). Happy Learning!
