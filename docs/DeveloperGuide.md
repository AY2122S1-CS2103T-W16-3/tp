### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of TutorAid.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

The architecture of TutorAid can first be divided into 6 components: `Main`, `Commons`, `UI`, `Logic`, `Model` and `Storage`

1. `Main`
* Has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tutoraid/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tutoraid/MainApp.java).
* It is responsible for the following operations:
  * At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other. 
  * At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

2. [**`Commons`**](#common-classes)
* Represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

3. [**`UI`**](#ui-component)
* Represents the UI of the App.
  
4. [**`Logic`**](#logic-component)
* Serves as the command executor.
  
5. [**`Model`**](#model-component)
* Holds the data of the App in memory.
  
6. [**`Storage`**](#storage-component)
* Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `del -s 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components shown in the diagram above:
* Defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the component.
* Implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned above).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface. It also implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class, which is based on the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below. It is designed as such to prevent outside components being coupled to the implementation of a component.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

### Components

The sections below provide more details on the following components: `UI`, `Logic`, `Model` and `Storage`.

#### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tutoraid/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `LessonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tutoraid/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student` and `Lesson` objects residing in the `Model`.

#### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tutoraid/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The `Logic` component mainly works in 2 different ways for 2 different types of commands:

**Commands with a unique command word**

This applies to the commands `help`, `clear` and `exit`.
  
The `Logic` component works as such:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `TutorAidParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (or more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `HelpCommand`), which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to open the help window).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("help")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `help` Command](images/HelpSequenceDiagram.png)
  
**Commands with non-unique command word**

Commands that have the same command word as (at least) 1 other command (e.g. `add -s` and `add -l`) is known to have a non-unique command word.
This applies to all the commands in TutorAid apart from those mentioned in the section above.

The process of parsing for commands with non-unique command words differs from those with unique command words as an additional step is required to differentiate between commands that share the same command word.

Below are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a command with non-unique command words:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: All `XYCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing
</div>

The `Logic` component works as such:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `TutorAidParser` class to parse the user command.
2. The result of the above step is then **further parsed** by another `Parser` class (specifically a class named after a command word e.g., `AddCommandParser`).
3. A `Command` object (or more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddStudentCommand`) is then created and is executed by the `LogicManager`.
4. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a student).
6. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

Here's a Sequence Diagram that illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("del -s 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `del -s 1` Command](images/DeleteStudentSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: Most of the interactions between the `DeleteStudentCommand` object and the objects of the `Model` class have not been depicted in this diagram as the focus lies in the interactions within the `Logic` class.
</div>

#### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the student and lesson data i.e., all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentList` object) and `Lesson` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueLessonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change. This is true for `Lesson` objects too.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

Each `Lesson` and `Student` object consists of fields as shown in the class diagrams below.

![](images/StudentClassDiagram.png)
![](images/LessonClassDiagram.png)


#### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tutoraid/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save students' data, lessons' data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from `TutorAidStudentStorage`, `TutorAidLessonStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add progress feature

#### Implementation

The add progress feature adds a progress entry to an existing student in TutorAid. Each student can have up to 10 progress entries. 
Adding a new entry to a student who already has 10 such entries will result in the deletion of the oldest entry.

This feature implements the following operations:
* `AddProgressCommand#execute()` —Creates a `Progress` object and adds it to a `ProgressList` object of a `Student` object
in TutorAid.

It is also facilitated by the methods below:
* `TutorAidParser#parseCommand()` — Checks for the command word that is required for the addition of a progress entry.
* `AddCommandParser#parse()` — Checks for the command flag that specifies the addition of a progress entry.
* `AddProgressCommandParser#parse()` — Parses the individual arguments to create a `Progress` object.

When a `Student` object is created, a `ProgressList` object is created for this `Student` object. This `ProgressList` object
stores an `ArrayList` of type `Progress` that keeps track of a maximum of 10 `Progress` objects. We implement `ProgressList`
as a field in `Student`.

![ProgressListClass](images/StudentWithProgressListClassDiagram.png)

Given below is an example of what happens when the user attempts to add a progress entry to a student in TutorAid
by entering a command:

`add -p 2 Did Homework​`

1. `LogicManager#execute()` is executed, where the above user input is passed into `TutorAidParser#parseCommand()`.

2. `TutorAidParser#parseCommand()` then extracts the first keyword of every command. Since the keyword `add` would be
   extracted, the remaining arguments of the command (`-p 2 Did Homework​`) are then passed into
   `AddCommandParser#parse()`.

3. `AddCommandParser#parse()` extracts the command flag `-p` at the start of its argument, which denotes the addition
   of a progress. Thus, the remaining (`2 Did Homework​`) is then passed into `AddProgressCommandParser#parse()`.

4. The remaining (`2 Did Homework​`) is then parsed into index `2` and progress description `Did Homework`, which
   are then used to construct an `AddProgressCommand` object. 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** 
At this point, if `AddProgressCommandParser#parse()` detects that invalid input has been supplied, the command will fail 
its execution and `ParseException` will be thrown.</div>

Below is the sequence diagram that depicts the parsing of the `add -p` command:
![ParseAddProgress](images/ParseAddProgressSequenceDiagram.png)

5. `LogicManager#execute()` then calls upon `AddProgressCommand#execute()`. It communicates with the `Model` to get the
   index-specified `Student` instance.

Below is the sequence diagram that depicts how `AddProgressCommand` gets the student to edit:
![GetStudentToAddProgress](images/GetStudentToAddProgressSequenceDiagram.png)

6. `AddProgressCommand` calls the `Student#addProgress()` to add the new progress to the specified student.

7. `AddProgressCommand` then calls the `Model#updateFilteredStudentList()` to update the data in the system with
   regard to this change.

8. The result of the `AddProgressCommand` execution is then encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object, which is
   returned to `LogicManager`.

Below is the sequence diagram that depicts the process of the adding a progress to a student:
![AddProgressToStudent](images/AddProgressToStudentSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to keep track of all the progress (maximum 10) of a student:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implements a ProgressList class.
    * Pros: Abstracts away the management of progress from the `Student` class.
    * Cons: Potentially more dependency.

* **Alternative 2:** Implements an `ArrayList` of type `Progress` in the `Student` class.
    * Pros: Easier to implement.
    * Cons: Student class may have too many responsibilities.

### Add student feature

#### Implementation

This feature adds a student contact to TutorAid. A student contact consists of the student's name, student's contact number, the parent's name and parent's contact number. 

The feature is mainly implemented by the following methods:
* `AddStudentCommand::execute()` — Adds a `Student` object to TutorAid.
  
It is also additionally facilitated by the methods below:
* `TutorAidParser#parseCommand()` — Checks for the command word that is required for the addition of a student 
  contact.
* `AddCommandParser#parse()` — Checks for the command flag that specifies the addition of a student contact.
* `AddStudentCommandParser#parse()` — Parses the individual arguments to create a `Student` object.
* `ModelManager#addStudent()` — Represents the in-memory model of TutorAid's student book data.
* `StudentBook#addStudent()` — Adds a student to TutorAid's student book.

Given below is an example of what happens when the user attempts to add a student contact to TutorAid by entering 
a command `add -s sn/John Doe …​`:

1. The command is first passed into `TutorAidParser#parseCommand()`, which extracts the first keyword of every command. 
   Since the keyword `add` would be extracted, the remaining arguments of the command (`-s sn/John Doe …​`) are passed 
   then into `AddCommandParser#parse()`.

2. `AddCommandParser#parse()` extracts the command flag `-s` at the start of its argument, which denotes the addition 
   of a student contact. Thus, the remaining (`sn/John Doe …​`) is passed into `AddStudentCommandParser#parse`.

3. Each of the different arguments of student contact, such as the student name, student contact number, parent name 
   and parent number, is parsed by `AddStudentCommandParser#parse()` based on the given input. 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** 
At this point, if `AddStudentCommandParser#parse()` detects that no student name has been supplied, the command will fail 
its execution and `ParseException` will be thrown.
</div>

4. For optional parameters, which are all parameters other the student's name, if the argument is not supplied by the
   user, a default argument (`""`) is instead supplied by the `AddStudentCommandParser#parse()`.

Below is the sequence diagram that depicts the parsing of the `add -s` command:
![ParseAddStudentCommand](images/ParseAddStudentCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

5. The individual arguments for the student contact are then passed into `Model#Student()` to create a `Student` object. 

6. The `AddStudentCommand#execute()` is then called upon to add the student into TutorAid. This in turn calls on 
   `ModelManager#addStudent()` and `StudentBook#addStudent()` to store the details of the new student contact in memory. 
   
7. Lastly, a `CommandResult` object is returned to notify the user that the student has been successfully added.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** 
If the student object created appears to be a duplicate of an existing contact (a contact is said to be a duplicate if 
all of its fields are the same as that of an existing contact), the new student object will not be stored in 
TutorAid and user will be alerted of the duplicate instead. 
</div>

Below is the sequence diagram that depicts an overview of a student contact being successfully added to TutorAid:
![AddStudent](images/AddStudentSequenceDiagram.png)

### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to differentiate the `add -s` command from other `add` commands:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The `add` command word and `-s` command flag 
  are parsed one after another, in two different classes. 
    * Pros: Better use of abstraction and increases cohesion, where one class only extracts the command word and 
      another class extracts the command flag.
    * Cons: Time taken to execute the command may increase as more classes and methods are required to execute it.

* **Alternative 2:** The `add` command word and `-s` command flag are parsed in the same class, by the same method. 
    * Pros: Command can be executed quickly as only one method is required to parse the command.
    * Cons: Having a single parse method may result in the method having multiple responsibilities to parse various 
      parts of a command, such as the command word, command flag and arguments.

### View student/lesson feature

#### Implementation

The proposed view student/lesson mechanism is facilitated by `ModelManager`. It implements `Model`, stored internally as a `modelManagerStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `ModelManager#viewStudent()` — Updates student panel with the student of interest and lesson panel with the lessons the student of interest is in.
* `ModelManager#viewLesson()` — Updates lesson panel with the lesson of interest and student panel with the students that are in this lesson of interest.

This operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#viewStudent()` and `Model#viewLesson()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the view student mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `ModelManager` will be initialized with the initial model manager state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single model manager state.

![ViewStudentState0](images/ViewStudentState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `view -s 1` command to view the 1st student in TutorAid. The `view -s` command calls `Model#viewStudent()`, causing the modified state of model manager after the `view -s 1` command executes to be saved in the `modelManagerStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that model manager state.

The following sequence diagram shows how the view student operation works:

![ViewStudentSequenceDiagram](images/ViewStudentSequenceDiagram.png)

A similar execution scenario can be expected for view lesson mechanism.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How view student/lesson executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Filters and updates view panel on command.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Filter list beforehand and update view panel on command.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `view -s`, just load the pre-generated student panel).
    * Cons: We must ensure that all possible view panels combinations are covered and this might cause slower application initialization.
    
### Card-like UI Elements

Card-like UI elements are objects that are shown to the user in their respective list panels, such as `StudentCard` which is displayed in the `StudentListPanel`. The Student Cards come in three flavours: `FullStudentCard` displays all fields to the user, `StudentCard` is the same but only displays the most recent `Progress` entry, and `MinimalStudentCard` only displays the index and the student's name. Lesson Cards come in 2 flavours: `LessonCard` (fully-detailed) and `MinimalLessonCard` (only index, name and timing). Having minimally-detailed variants keeps the list compact and allows the user to view more entries. 

These UI elements inherit the `Card` class, which in turn inherits `UiPart<Region>`. 

![CardClassDiagram](images/CardClassDiagram.png)


At all times, the `LessonListPanel` and `StudentListPanel` in the `MainWindow` will display Lessons and Students from the model using either the fully-detailed or minimal `Card` objects. The variant being displayed depends on the user command: `list -a` will cause both panels to display all details (apart from student progress - only the latest one is shown) while `list` will cause both panels to display only minimal details. Most other commands that affect the `Model` will cause all information to be displayed, especially for edited components.


The two panels are kept in sync: Lessons in the `LessonListPanel` are those that are attended by Students in the `StudentListPanel`.

There are thus three static instances of `StudentListPanel` and two of `LessonListPanel` - one for each variant. Every time the `Model` is updated, `MainWindow#fillStudentCard()` and `MainWindow#fillLessonCard()` will be called to ensure that the correct variant is displayed in the `MainWindow`. The sequence diagram below shows how this works:

![CardUiSequence](images/CardUiSequence.png)

When `fillStudentCard(DetailLevel.MED)` or `fillLessonCard(DetailLevel.MED)` are called during the execution of a `list -a` command, the `studentListPanelPlaceholder` and `lessonListPanelPlaceholder` in `MainWindow` are cleared of its nodes to prepare them to accept new nodes (panels). Then, the correct `studentListPanel` and `lessonListPanel` with all details are inserted, thus displaying the fully-detailed panels (minus the full `Progress` of the `Student` objects) to the user.

Conversely, if a user chooses to hide the details by executing `list`, `UiManager#showDetails(DetailLevel.LOW)` will be called instead, which will call `fillStudentCard(DetailLevel.LOW)` and `fillLessonCard(DetailLevel.LOW)` and hide the details.

The `FullStudentCard` is only used for the `view` command, in which the user wishes to view only a specific `Student` and their corresponding `Lessons` / `Lesson` and its corresponding `Students`. Then, all fields are displayed, including the 10 most recent `Progress` entries for each `Student`.

The above applies to the scenario when the user inputs a command which calls a method that changes the detail visibility of the cards. In contrast, during the application launch, `MainApp` calls the `start` method of `UiManager` which calls `MainWindow#fillInnerParts()`. The details are shown below:

![CardUiSequenceLaunch](images/CardUiSequenceLaunch.png)

The panels default to `StudentCard` and `LessonCard` for the application launch, thus showing most details to the user but not the complete list of `Progress` entries.

***

### Add lesson feature

#### Implementation

This feature adds a lesson to TutorAid. A lesson consists of the lesson name, capacity, pricing, timing and student list.

This feature implements the following operations:

* `AddLessonCommand#execute()` - Adds a `Lesson` object to TutorAid.

This feature is additionally facilitated by the following operations:

* `TutorAidParser#parseCommand()` - Checks for the command word that is required for the addition of a lesson.
* `AddCommandParser#parse()` - Checks for the command flag that specifies the addition of a lesson.
* `AddLessonCommandParser#parse()` - Parses the arguments provided to create a `Lesson` object.

To represent a lesson and its details, a `Lesson` class is introduced. Its class diagram can be seen below.

<img src="images/LessonClassDiagram.png" width="500"/>

Given below is an example usage scenario for adding a lesson to TutorAid, and how the command is executed.

1. The user executes `add -l n/Maths 1 c/15` to add a lesson named `Maths 1` which has a capacity of `15` to TutorAid. `LogicManager#execute()` is executed, where the user input is passed into `TutorAidParser#parseCommand()`. 

2. This in turn calls `AddCommandParser#parse()`, where the string `-l n/Maths 1 c/15` is passed in as the argument. Due to the command flag `-l` at the start of the argument, `AddLessonCommandParser#parse()` is called to parse the remaining parameters `n/Maths 1 c/15` into lesson details.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** 
At this point, if `AddLessonCommandParser#parse()` detects that no lesson name has been supplied, the command will fail 
its execution and `ParseException` will be thrown.
</div>

3. The original arguments (Maths 1 and 15) are used for the parameters `lessonName` and `capacity` respectively. Since the optional parameters (`price` and `timing`) are not provided in the command, a default argument (`""`)  is supplied for these parameters. These parameters are then used to create `LessonName`, `Price`, `Capacity` and `Timing` instances.

4. These individual instances, along with a `Students` object containing an empty `ArrayList<Student>`,  are then used to create a `Lesson` object. This `Lesson` instance is used to create a `AddLessonCommand` object.

Below is the sequence diagram that depicts the parsing of the command `add -l n/Maths 1 c/15`, and the instantiation of the `AddLessonCommand` object.

<img src="images/ParseAddLessonCommandSequenceDiagram.png" height="250"/>

5. `AddLessonCommand#execute()` is then called to add the lesson to TutorAid. 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** 
At this point, if the newly created lesson has the same lesson name as an existing lesson in TutorAid, the lesson will not be added into TutorAid, and the user will be alerted of this.
</div>

6. This in turn calls on `ModelManager#addLesson()` and `LessonBook#addLesson()` to store the details of the new lesson in memory. 

7. A `CommandResult` object is then created and returned to notify the user that the lesson, with the specified details, has been successfully added to TutorAid.

Below is the sequence diagram that depicts the adding of the newly created `Lesson` object to TutorAid.

<img src="images/AddLessonSequenceDiagram.png" />
